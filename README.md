## 📝 General Info

**Odin Recipes** is a static multi-page site that presents three Japanese cuisine recipes.  
It was created to practice core skills in:

- Writing semantic HTML
- Structuring a clean file-based project
- Styling with CSS (typography, layout, responsiveness)

This project is a personal learning milestone and serves as a baseline for tracking my progress as I learn web development.
